## Project is due 16-April @ 11:59 - Start early and ask questions of your instructor.

This project should be your __INDIVIDUAL__ work. 

Do NOT look at anyone else's code, nor show your code to anyone else!

You MAY discuss general questions about exceptions (e.g. how to create a new exception, or implement a try/except block) under empty hands rules.
Do NOT discuss specific questions about this assignment.

Only part of this assignment is graded, but it is to your advantage to review and understand the demo files
